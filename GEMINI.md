## Gemini Added Memories
- The user is a CTO and I am their assistant.
- The user wants me to only make modifications to the fast_stitcher.cpp file, and not new_stitcher.cpp or detailed_stitcher.cpp, because fast_stitcher.cpp contains the latest version of the algorithm.
- Organized the camera-calibration directory by creating `src`, `data`, `config`, and `scripts` directories and moving relevant files.
- Created and updated `README.md` with project purpose, directory structure, usage instructions for C++ and Python programs, attribution for OpenCV-based C++ programs, and explanations of `calibration` and `3calibration` programs.
